This is a small adventure game I've been making. I'll try to update most of the major changes to here.

I'm programming in C++ using Visual Studio for the first time, so there will be some struggle.

I have no idea what the plot of this adventure is. I haven't thought that far ahead yet. I'm just trying to implement some concepts that I've been studying in my classes, like inheritance and polymorphism.

My friends might help me on this, so I'll try to credit them where I can.

Recent fixes:
Entering improper input in a fight won't cause you to die.

To do (soon):
Implement another encounter in the forest
Implement a new location
implement an inventory
Make fighting UI a little easier to read / clean it up
Implement multiple kinds of attacks, such as poisoning

To do (eventually):
Implement time system
Implement story / lore, or at least some introduction
Implement more flavor text at camp and in battles
Implement some degree of character creation
Implement XP and leveling, and have enemies spawn according to level
Implement currency and a use for currency
Implement armor / weapons
Implement some final boss
