# Alka

current version: 0.0.2

This is a small adventure game I've been making. I'll try to update most of the major changes to here.

I'm programming in C++ using Visual Studio for the first time, so there will be some struggle.

I have no idea what the plot of this adventure is. I haven't thought that far ahead yet. I'm just trying to implement some concepts that I've been studying in my classes, like inheritance and polymorphism.

My friends might help me on this, so I'll try to credit them where I can.
